# Dice
## The Goal: 
Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice.
When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between user input interval.
The program will print what that number is. 
It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again.
For this project, you’ll need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. that means a minimum and a maximum. 
You’ll also want a function that randomly grabs a number within that range and prints it.

## Concepts to keep in mind:
- Random
- Integer
- Print
- While Loops
